# Global Configuration #
########################

# These values affect the whole application

# Stylesheet
# Change this to use a custom stylesheet, or change the location of your stylesheet
# Default: /etc/kilauncher/stylesheet.css

stylesheet: "/home/lauchlan/.kilauncher/stylesheet.css"

# Icon Theme
# Change the icon theme used for launcher icons when only an icon name (not path) is specified
# Probably only works in Linux, according to QT documentation
# Default: whatever your qt is configured to use

icon_theme: "Tango"

# Show Quit Button
# If you need people to be able to exit the program, set this to true
# Default: false

show_quit_button: True

# You can also set the text of the quit button
# It defaults to "X"

#quit_button_text: "Quit this program"

# Turning on aggressive icon search can help find icons for badly configured .desktop files.
# It also vastly increases start time, especially on slow systems.
# Default: False

#aggressive_icon_search: True


# The "autostart" feature lets you specify some commands to run whenever KiLauncher is launched.
# This could be useful if you want to run a window manager or panel, for instance.

#autostart: ["openbox", "xeyes", "xterm -e htop"]

# Tabs and Launchers #
######################

# This nested structure defines tabs and the launchers contained within
# NOTE that this config may not work on your system if you don't have these programs installed.

tabs_and_launchers:

  1:
    name: "Programs"
    # Note the absence of the hyphen.  This is a property of the tab itself, not part of a launchers array.
    # Also note the use of the wildcard character in the name.  That's allowed.
    # keep in mind, you have no control over the ordering if you go this route.
    desktop_path: "/home/lauchlan/.kilauncher/apps/*.desktop"

    # Tabs can also specify
    #  - the maximum number of launchers in a row,
    #  - the size of the launchers
    #  - the size of the icons on the launcher
    # By default, launchers are 240x80, and the number is determined by the screen size.
    # Default size of icons is 64x64
#    launchers_per_row: 3
#    launcher_size: 360x120
#    icon_size: 96x72
